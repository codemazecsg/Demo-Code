Assuming you have a SQLDW/Synapse Server

1.  Register the system managed identity using Powershell (use register-sqldw.ps1 as a guide)
2.  Grant permissions to SQLDW to ADLSGen2 (++Storage Blob Contributor)
3.  Create & assign load user

either:

[POLYBASE]:
4.  Create external objects 
5.  Create external table
6.  Logon as loaduser & Load table w/ CTAS

[COPY INTO]:
4.  Create dbo owned table
5.  Logon as loaduser & Load table w/ COPY INTO
